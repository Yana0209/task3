This project demonstrates the setup of ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for consistent code formatting.

## Overview

- **ESLint**: Linting tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter that enforces a consistent style.
- **Husky**: Git hooks manager that runs scripts before certain Git events (e.g., commits).
- **lint-staged**: Runs ESLint and Prettier only on staged files before committing.
